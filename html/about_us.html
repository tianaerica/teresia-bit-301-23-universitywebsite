                <title>Kiriri Womenâ€™s University is a
                    leading institution dedicated to academic excellence</title>

                    <p>
                        We hold the view that Science and Technology is an indispensable tool 
                        in harnessing resources of nature for sustainable development and creating 
                        an environment in which human beings can survive and realise their potential; 
                        the human person has the moral obligation to creatively improve the environment.
                        The philosophy of KWUST is to lead to the development of human capital through 
                        scientific search based on Christian principles. This is achieved through an educational, 
                        scientific and technological approach through which every human being must rightfully experience 
                        and acquire the tools to actualise this philosophy.
